# OpenSteg

An open source steganography tool written in JavaScript.

## Description

Cryptography is the act of encoding text within other text. Cryptography has existed for centuries, dating back to almost thousands of years ago.

Steganography, however, is the act of encoding text within images. Computers have revolutionized steganography, and with OpenSteg, I tried to build my own steganography tool. There already exist many steganography tools out there, but OpenSteg is one of the only to be **written in client-side JavaScript**. That's right. No PHP or Node.js, no libraries, just JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. In fact, the entire program is condensed into a single HTML file.
